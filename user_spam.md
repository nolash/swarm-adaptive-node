## Rationale ##

## User-Story ##

As a sender and recipient of pss messages, I want to be able to rely on that there are enough resources on the network to make sure my message is received by the recipient.

The cost of the service should be affordable. However, it should also be high enough that it's not cheap to keep the network busy with useless traffic.

I also want to avoid that my own resources get drained by handling/forwarding a high volume of useless traffic.

The cost can be any proof of resource expenditure, but it needs to be cost I can bear. For example, if I don't have a lot of power and computational resource available, I should be able to pay some other way.

## Acceptance criteria ##

### Minimally viable

1. The same or better than Whisper PoW for heterogenerous devices when it comes to DoS protection
2. Some form of quantified griefing factor that is proportional to network load

Example of 2 would be basic proof-of-burn that is proportional to the address,
i.e. it costs more to send to a more neighborhood. Note that minimally viable
doesn't include generalized incentivization of delivery and forwarding etc.
